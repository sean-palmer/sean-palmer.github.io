	<h1>Sean Palmer | About</h1>
	<p>Hi there! I'm Sean and I'm a DevOps Engineer in Workday. I love automation and want to automate the world!

    I was originally born in South Africa, and moved to Ireland when I was seven. I went to St. Andrews College for primary and secondary school. Like most kids these days I spent a lot of my time playing video games and on computers growing up. Howver I have always had the passion of figuring out how things worked. I have always wanted to know how a toaster or traffic lights work. Naturally this sparked an interest in software development for me. With the ever expanding technology sector it was only natural that I venture into the tech industry. I went to college at Dublin Institute of Technology studying Computer Science. There I learned not only how to code but also how to problem solve and enabled my passion for figuring out how stuff worked.

	After four years at DIT, and an internship in third year at the Revenue Commissioners I somehow landed myself in Workday. I started at Workday in July 2016 as a Software Engineer. Since then I have dedicated myself to enabling my teams and the teams around me to become the best they can be. I mainly did this around my own work as I love helping people and automating everything. We recently just started a brand new DevOps team dedicated to helping the teams throughout my department. Being able to work on this fulltime allows me to dedicate more of my team to helping people and automating all the things. I love being able to help teams automate their processes to make them more efficient and autonomous.</p>
