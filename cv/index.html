	<h2>Java Developer Internship at Revenue Commissioners</h2>
	<h3>January 2015 - July 2015</h3>
	<p>During the third year of my degree, I spent seven months at an internship in the Revenue Commissioners. I used Java for most of the internship, with some JavaScript for the frontend of my projects. This internship opened me up to many new technologies. I learnt and used the Spring Framework for all my projects. I also got exposure to Maven and JUnit among some other tools such as Jenkins and SonarQube. I was lucky to have a great team that taught me how to use these tools. I learned how to write unit tests as well as how to write testable code. I also worked on an intern led project for the HR department and created a tool to allow HR to manage and plan training resources. This tool is still in use and was rolled out to other office sites.</p>

	<h2>Software Developement Enginner at Workday</h2>
	<h3>July 2016 - January 2018</h3>
	<p>In July 2016 I started as Software Engineer in the Implementation Tools department in Workday. I spent much of my time developing features using Workdays propietary language. I also worked on a few Java features. Outside of my normal work, I dedicated myself to helping my team and others to improve their pipelines and automation. I quickly became the "Jenkins" guy for my department, helping many teams and projects. I also became very interested in automation and reformed the way my team was doing QA. I also setup a QA community of practice within my department.</p>

	<h2>DevOps Engineer at Workday</h2>
	<h3>February 2018 - Current</h3>
	<p>We setup a DevOps team within my department, with the goal of supporting the teams with their pipeline and operational issues. I was the first member and the team was created out of the work that I did to highlight the many issues we had. This team aims to solve all those issues as well as help teams to make their processes more efficient and autonomous.</p>
